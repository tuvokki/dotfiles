Dotfiles

This is an attempt to get some more unity in the way I use my commandline in osx and linux. I have made one important step about a thousand years ago: the usage of [zsh](http://www.zsh.org/).

Zsh is a shell designed for interactive use, although it is also a powerful scripting language.

As many shell-related stuff, zsh come with a 'dotfile' to configure the general usage and look and feel. I would like to have as much consistency in the usage and look and feel in my shells. And it shoudn't be too different under linux or mac os.

That is why I have divided the files in some inclides. These includes are in the following categories:

* general configuration
* aliasses
* host-specific files
* files to support intended use (like desktop or webserver systems)

The initial commit in this repository is the set of dotfiles I use on my linux webserver. That is why there are the following files:

*.zshrc*
the general configuration. This file should be exactly the same on all systems.

*.zsh.alias*
The aliasses file. Also intended to be the same on all systems.

*.zsh.host*
Host specific aliasses and settings.

*.zsh.web*
Webserver specific aliasses, settings and functions.

Also there is a file called *.zsh.hist* which holds the history. This should be generated by zsh.
